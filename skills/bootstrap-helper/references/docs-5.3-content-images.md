### Bootstrap Responsive Images

Source: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images

Makes images responsive by applying max-width: 100% and height: auto. This ensures images scale with their parent container. Requires the `.img-fluid` class.

```html
<img src="..." class="img-fluid" alt="...">
```
